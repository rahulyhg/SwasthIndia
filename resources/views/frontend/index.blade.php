                        <p>Swasth India is an health care application which will help every Indian to keep track of their health records. The idea is to create a central database of health records. This can aid health practitioners in providing better and more accurate treatment by looking at the medical history of patients. </p>
                        <p>This will also reduce the time required to attend a patient. So while we work on increasing the doctors to patient ratio in our country, this can increase the number of patients a doctor can attend to.</p>

                        <p>Swasth India is not just about that but it is a assortment of multiple solutions within one application.</p>

                        Some of the features of this application are mentioned below
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
